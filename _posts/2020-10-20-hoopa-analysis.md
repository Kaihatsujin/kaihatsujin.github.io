The Hoopa movie is one that people don't seem to talk about much, but after finally watching it I was pretty amazed at how much is true to the place it was based on: Dubai! And seeing as I know the real place like the back of my hand I thought I'd go through the film and see how well things have been depicted - with a little help from my friend Lockstin!
