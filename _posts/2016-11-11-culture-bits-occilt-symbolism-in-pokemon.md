After watching Lockstin's series of videos about alchemical symbolism, there were a few things I noticed in other Pokémon games, so I thought I would make a video about it!
This video is out a little later than planned, and as such some things may or may not have been proved/disproved with the Pokémon Sun & Moon leaks.
