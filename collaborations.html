<h3>So, you're looking to do a collaboration?</h3>

<p>Maybe! Please read the guidelines below to find out if your channel is suitable.</p>

<h1>Requirements for potential collaborators</h1>

<h2>General</h2>

<p>Please note that all collaborations are reviewed manually, and are only subject to instant rejection if there is a high volume of requests. This is to ensure that the quality of Kaihatsu content is upheld. Although Kaihatsu is a small channel, accepting every request for a collaboration will result in a negative feedback loop where less viewers engage with videos, which makes the algorithym push the channel's videos less. All declined requests will be given a reason why, so that your content may be improved upon. </p>

<p> While there is no limit on the amount of times you can apply, we reccomend that you wait at least 6 months before re-requesting, in order to give yourself time to improve the quality of your videos.</p>

<h2>Suitable channels</h2>

<p>Although exceptions are (very rarely) made, below is a

<h2>What programs do you use to make videos?</h2>

<p>I use the Adobe Creative Cloud suite, but the main programs I use from that are Photoshop (image editing), Premiere (video editing), After Effects (special effects) and Audition (sound recording). I also use effects suites from Red Giant and some other companies to make my videos look a bit more stylised sometimes.

<h2>What microphone/other equipment do you use?</h2>

<p>My microphone is an Audio Technica AT2020USB+ microphone. I also use a microphone stand. For graphics editing I use a Wacom Intuous Pro drawing tablet. My computer is custom built.
</p>
<hr>

<h2>Could you help me edit/make a video?</h2>

<p>Sorry! I'd love to help out but I'm far too busy to do things like that right now. I might give editing lessons in the future if I have spare time though.</p>
<hr>

<h2>I make videos! Could we work together?</h2>

<p>Maybe! I'm always looking to work with other like minded and talented people. Send an email to business[at]kaihatsusha[dot]com and I'll get back to you.</p>
<p><i><small>Please bear in mind that I can only really consider working with you if you have decent audio and video/editing quality, similar in quality to that found in 'The Science Behind Super Mario Sunshine'. Small channels should also have at least 300 subscribers (around 30% of my subscriber base).</small></i><p>

<h2>What happened to The Science Behind?</h2>

<p>Well recently I've been tied down with Nostalgia Trip, and at the moment that is my priority. I've been experimenting with the Science Behind so that I can make shorter videos and get them out more frequently.</p>
<p>To be honest, I prefer to make videos about culture and art so sometimes it can be difficult to get myself to write about a topic that I'm not interested in or familiar with - this is why Science Behind episodes have been so infrequent. I'm still going to work on the series but there have been a couple times already where I've got close to cancelling it, so don't be surprised if in the future I just amalgamate it with my theory series.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Are you a COMMUNIST?</h2>

<p>Haha, no. I get this all the time because of Marxist March, but no, I am not remotely communist.</p>
<hr>

<h2>What is that blob thing in your videos?</h2>

<p>I honestly don't know... I tried asking it but it won't tell me.</p>
