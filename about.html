<p>Hey there! I'm Kaihatsu. I am a game design student based in the UK who wound up making YouTube videos. I like to make videos about art and culture in video games, but I also tackle other subjects that I enjoy, such as history, science, politics and geography and how they relate to gaming.
</p>

<p>Currently I do YouTube as a hobby.
</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy my videos!</p>

<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<hr>
<h2>How did you start on YouTube?</h2>

<p>I started my first channel back in 2013 - with limited success. My original channel was mostly about ROM hacking and was mainly just me talking on my terrible netbook that was my only computer at the time. Later on that year I started messing around with photoshop at school and gradually taught myself how to use it. However, I was stuck with Movie Maker and Paint for making videos. After only gaining 22 subscribers, I lost motivation, stopped making videos, and made a new channel which I never uploaded with until I renamed it and made it my second channel, after making my new channel called Kaihatsu.
</p>
<p>My new channel was originally for uploading music remixes that I made, but I started to work on a side project called 'The Science Behind Super Mario Sunshine' while learning how to use Adobe Premiere as well as other programs from the Creative Cloud Suite. After uploading that first proper video, I knew that I wanted to make more videos like it, and now here we are!

<h2>How can I get started on YouTube?</h2>

<p>All I did at the start was invest in some decent editing software and put lots of relevant tags in my videos. I also shared a lot of my videos on Reddit. However, one inconvenient truth that people don't like to hear about YouTube is that nowadays with so many channels competing to cover the same topics, you do need to have good audio and video/editing quality to attract people to your channel. Polish isn't everything, but it keeps people coming back.

<h2>What programs do you use to make videos?</h2>

<p>I use the Adobe Creative Cloud suite, but the main programs I use from that are Photoshop, Premiere, After Effects and Audition. I also use effects suites from Red Giant and some other companies to make my videos look a bit more stylised sometimes.

<h2>What microphone/other equipment do you use?</h2>

<p>My (now livestreaming only) microphone is an Audio Technica AT2020USB+ microphone. For recording I now use a Zoom H5 Handy Recorder. I also use a microphone stand. My camera is a Sony FDR AX33. For graphics editing I use a Wacom Intuous Pro drawing tablet. My computer is custom built.

<h2>Could you help me edit/make a video?</h2>

<p>I'm currently unavailable for paid editing work. I do editing in a professional capacity, and it is not equivalent to a collaboration. I may also give editing lessons in the future if I have spare time.</p>
<hr>

<h2>I make videos! Could we work together?</h2>

<p>I'm always looking to work with other like minded and talented people. Working with others depends on what content they create and how good it is. Because I get a lot of emails asking to collaborate I have some prerequisites for channels that want to work with me. Please see below to check that you're good to go!</p>
	
<p><i><small>Please bear in mind that I can only really consider working with you if you have decent audio and video/editing quality, similar in quality to any of my videos from 2017 onwards.</small></i><p>

<h2>What is that blob thing in your videos?</h2>

<p>I honestly don't know... I tried asking it but it won't tell me.</p>
